Pulse Detector using WebRTCs
==================

Inspired by https://github.com/thearn/webcam-pulse-detector and current advancements in WebRTCs, I am set out to create an completely javascript based pulse detector. 

This uses ccv in conjunction with https://github.com/wesbos/HTML5-Face-Detection to correctly detect the face, seperate the forehead, and then do calculations. 

I still need to figure out how would i find the pulse :)
