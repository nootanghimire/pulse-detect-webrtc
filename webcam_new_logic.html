    <p>A new logic Could be: First, find the face area. Calculate the forehead. Tell the use not to move. Make sure you can calculate average optical intensity at forehead area (fixed area)in green channel before 100 ms. Collect as much data as possible (2^n) each within 100ms time frame, FFT, filter, find peak within 0.8-3Hz freq, and that's the BPM!</p>
